# Protocol-Aware AI

A values-shaped assistant that listens to nostr relays, scans trusted sources, and reposts content aligned with clarity, autonomy, and reflection; under your own identity.

This assistant was designed for presence, not performance. It does not reply, engage, or optimize for attention. It filters quotes and signals that resonate with its owner, then reposts them from a personal `npub`.
